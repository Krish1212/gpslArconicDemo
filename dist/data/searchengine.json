[{"id":"0","title":"Rotor","description":"A. Pumping Cartridge As mentioned in Section II, fluid flow is developed by the pumping cartridge. The action of the cartridge is illustrated in Figure 2. The rotor is driven within the cam ring by the driveshaft, which is coupled to a power source. As the rotor turns, centrifugal force causes the vanes to follow the elliptical inner surface of the cam ring.","url":"http:\/\/gpsl.co\/_subdomains\/arconic\/drawings_3.php","keywords":"rotor"}, {"id":"2","title":"Vane","description":"This manual has been prepared to assist the users of Vickers balanced vane type \r\nhydraulic single pumps in properly installing, maintaining and repairing their units. In the sections which follow, the single pumps are described in detail, their theory of operation is discussed and instructions are given for their proper installation, maintenance and overhaul.","url":"http:\/\/gpsl.co\/_subdomains\/arconic\/machinery.php","keywords":"Vane"}, {"id":"3","title":"Vane","description":"The V200 series pump illustrated in the cutaway in Figure 1 is representative of all single pumps in this series. The unit\r\nconsists principally of a ported body and cover, a drive shaft supported by two ball bearings, a pumping cartridge and a\r\npressure plate. Components of the pumping cartridge are an elliptical cam ring, a slotted rotor splined to the drive shaft\r\nand twelve vanes fitted to the rotor slots.","url":"http:\/\/gpsl.co\/_subdomains\/arconic\/drawings_3.php","keywords":"vane"}, {"id":"4","title":"Shaft Rotation","description":"Pumps are normally assembled for right-hand (clockwise) rotation as viewed from the shaft end. A pump made for left-hand rotation is identified by an \u201cL\u201d in the model code","url":"http:\/\/gpsl.co\/_subdomains\/arconic\/drawings_3.php","keywords":"Shaft Rotation"}, {"id":"5","title":"","description":"As the rotor is driven by the driveshaft, the vanes generate fluid flow by carrying fluid around the elliptical ring contour\r\n(see Section III). Fluid enters the cartridge through the inlet port in the body and is discharged through the pressure plate to the outlet port in the cover.","url":"http:\/\/gpsl.co\/_subdomains\/arconic\/drawings_3.php","keywords":"rotor"}]
